    Welcome to <strong>Game Recs</strong> — a game recommendation website built by two passionate students from <strong>President University</strong>.  
    We’re <strong>Abyan Nur Zaky</strong> and <strong>Satrio</strong>, the creators behind this project.  
  </p>

  <p style="color: #ccc; line-height: 1.8; font-size: 1.05em;">
    This website was developed as part of our <strong>Web Programming Project</strong> under the <em>Information Systems</em> study program.  
    Our main goal is to create a visually modern, interactive, and user-friendly platform that helps players discover the best games to play —  
    whether it’s legendary titles like <strong>Sekiro</strong> or indie masterpieces like <strong>Hollow Knight</strong> and <strong>Hades</strong>.
  </p>

  <p style="color: #bbb; line-height: 1.8; font-size: 1.05em;">
    We designed <strong>Game Recs</strong> with passion for gaming and a touch of creativity in web design.  
    Here, we blend aesthetics and functionality to bring you an experience that feels both modern and immersive.  
    This project reflects not just our coding journey, but also our shared enthusiasm for games that inspire, challenge, and connect people.
